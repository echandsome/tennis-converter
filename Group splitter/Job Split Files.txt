The job is to split files by date like this


Enter a number between 1-100

If I enter 5, it will take one file and split like this

It will always look in Column P (Date)


File 1
(04-25)
(04-24)
(04-23)
(04-22)
(04-21)


File 2
(04-24)
(04-23)
(04-22)
(04-21)
(04-20)

File 3
(04-23)
(04-22)
(04-21)
(04-20)
(04-19)



*Last 5 dates, BUT they may not always be sequential. It might look like this


File 4
(04-22)
(04-15)
(04-12)
(04-07)
(04-06)


**Name each file with the date range like this 

File_001_0421_0425
File_002_0420_0424
File_001_0419_0423
