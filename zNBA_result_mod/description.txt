so I have a script I need to speed way up that scrapes data from bettingpros.com

I have a similar script that goes super fast by using "requests" so i am told

it grabs different data from betting pros dot com

regardless the script I need speeded up uses the player slug in column A to grab each result

this is the player slug for the 1st url of where the script goes to to get the row 1 result

Column Q iin the "After Results File" is the only column grabbed from bettingpros, the other 3 columns are just math and formatting from existing columns
