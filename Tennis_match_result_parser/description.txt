I need a script to add the W and L for Win and Loss in column S

I need it to calculate the Sets in columns E-K

you cant just add them up as its wrong some times

it need to add each set separately and find the higher number of winning sets

like 1 out of 1, 2 out of 2, 2 out of 3, 3 out of 4, 3 out of 5
9

its like the best of winning sets

(its not always the bottom player that wins)

the winner always has won more sets, but not always more points when all seta are added up together

the winner always has won more sets, but not always more points when all seta are added up together

row 5444 and 5445 are a good example

the winning player had 16 points and the losing player had 18 points

BUT the winning player had 2 winning sets hence the higher number in 

so the script just needs to tally who has the highest number in each set most often and count them as the winner
