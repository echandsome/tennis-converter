I need an imbalance script.

It needs parameters I can set for testing


1. MAXIMUM dates/rows to look back
*enter a number like 5 or 7 etc



2. Minimum off set of daily differences

if 3 minimum is set for example, it will look for a (combined dates) DAILY difference of 3 or higher

*enter a number like 5 or 7 etc

This means it will only include results like these

Mars_Neptune-BLK_Balls
Mars_Node-BLK_Balls

that have a score of +3 or more


I need to generate a report and be able to run the report against a daily file to get a count



The script will create a count for each player using Column N of the daily input file.
